## General info
This project is for training purpose, it is not aimed to implement something for production, although it could be use for entertainement. I coded this game to learn how to implement graphical interface and to solidify my knowledge in Python.

## Screenshots
Coming soon...

## Technologies
* Python - version 3.8.5

## Setup
This project has been only tested on Linux Manjaro Nibia 20.2.1.

### On Linux:
No specific dependencies are required for this project.
## On Windows:
No tests have been launched on Windows for the moment.

## Features
* All basic mechanics of a Tic-Tac-Toe game
* CLI for user interaction
* Dumb AI (plays random moves)

To-do list:
* GUI
* Unbeatable AI
* Save/Load a game mechanism

## Launch
After all dependencies has been installed, launch the project with a terminal on the source folder and type:
```bash
python guiCli.py
```
After that, follow the indications on the terminal.

## Code Example

## Status
This project is _in progress_ because the GUI and the unbeatable AI are missing.

## Inspiration and Sources
The Minimax algorithm is based on the tutorials of [Kylie Ying](https://github.com/kying18).
